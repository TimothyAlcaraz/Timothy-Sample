			<td>A golden retriever dog stands alone as the most popular dog breed in America. These dogs are serious workers at hunting and field work, as guides for the blind, and in search-and-rescue, enjoy obedience and other competitive events, and have an charming love of life when not at work.</td>
			<td>Labrador Retriever, a dog who is known for gentleness, tolerance, and intelligence. Their easy-going nature is what makes them the top choice as American family dogs. Also, they are very good with kids and being adorable is what makes them popular.</td>
			<td>A bulldog is known for being kind but courageous and friendly but dignified. This dog also has a thick-set, low-slung, well-muscled bruiser whose 'sourmug' face is the universal symbol of courage and tenacity. They are the best at guarding the homestead, herding, catching livestock and hunting feral pigs. </td>
